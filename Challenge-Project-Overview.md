## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes
*(This section is for BTT staff and CAs only — remove before sharing with students)*

### Technical Vetting
| Check | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | The project uses a Python-centric tech stack, aligning with students' existing skills and resources. |
| Data Readiness | 🟡 | The dataset is estimated to be between 5 GB and 10 GB. While it is not over the 10GB threshold, the project's success will depend on the complexity and cleanliness of the synthetic data, which may require substantial preprocessing. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 | All required resources, including software and tools, are accessible via Google Colab, which is user-friendly for students and eliminates infrastructure concerns. |

### Internal Scores
- **Student Fit Score:** 7/10
- **Technical Depth Score:** 8/10
- **Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

### Advisor Feedback Draft
The project addresses a relevant and timely issue in hospitality management—a strong starting point. To enhance student engagement, consider the following suggestions: 1. Simplify the SHAP integration for better understanding among students and provide additional resources or tutorials. 2. Provide clarity on how to clean and preprocess the synthetic data to avoid mismatched expectations. This would benefit students in managing workload efficiently throughout the semester. Overall, I encourage you to clarify these gaps in your project outline to better empower students. Let's ensure they have a comprehensive learning experience while tackling real-world applications.

# No-Show Fraud Detection: Protecting Hotel Inventory from Loyalty Reservation Abuse

**Company / Org:** Wyndham Hotels & Resorts  
**Challenge Advisor:** Danielle Golinski, danielle.golinski@wyndham.com  
**Program:** Break Through Tech AI Studio - Fall 2026  

---

## 🏢 About Wyndham Hotels & Resorts
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts is a global leader in the hospitality industry, operating a vast portfolio of hotel brands across various price points and geographic regions. The team's objective is to safeguard inventory and maintain the integrity of their loyalty program by identifying and mitigating fraudulent reservation patterns.

---

## 🎯 The Challenge
### Project Summary
Students will utilize synthetic loyalty data to build a supervised classification model that identifies fraudulent members who habitually book rooms without the intent to stay to exploit loyalty points. By employing XGBoost and SHAP explainability, the team will develop a system to flag high-risk accounts, effectively protecting hotel inventory and preventing the depletion of loyalty point liability.

### Success Criteria
A model that catches a meaningful share of fraudulent accounts before redemption at a workable false positive rate; a SHAP-powered dashboard for analyst use; and a final presentation quantifying catch rates, costs of false positives, and deployment requirements.

### Project Milestones
Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a GitHub Projects board to track tasks within each milestone.
| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **September** | Data Exploration & Preprocessing | Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify no-show patterns and establish robust data cleaning pipelines for handling synthetic reservation logs. |
| **October** | Feature Engineering & Baseline Modeling | Develop core behavioral features from reservation history and train a baseline logistic regression model to benchmark performance against class imbalances. |
| **November** | Model Optimization & Evaluation | Apply SMOTE to address class imbalance, train an optimized XGBoost classifier, and integrate SHAP TreeExplainer for model interpretability. |
| **December** | Insights, Deliverables & Presentation | Develop an analyst-facing dashboard for risk monitoring and synthesize findings into a business case and final project presentation. |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📊 Dataset
**Name and Source:** Wyndham Loyalty Reservation Dataset (Internal Synthetic Archive)  
**Format:** CSV, TSV, or Excel (.xlsx)  
**Size:** 5gb to 10gb  
**Location:** Secure internal repository provided by the challenge advisor.  

### Key Details
- Reservation and redemption data provided by the organization (potentially synthetic) in CSV/TSV or Excel (.xlsx) formats. Documentation including a data dictionary is available.
- Features include timestamps of bookings, no-show indicators, point accrual/redemption cycles, and member account tenure. Preprocessing must account for temporal drift and synthetic data noise.
